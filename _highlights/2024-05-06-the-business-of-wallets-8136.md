title: The Business of Wallets

**Supercharging the margin possibilities by disintermediating the card ecosystems is the primary economic advantage of wallets capable of holding balances**. I bolded that for emphasis because non-specialists routinely assume that the thing that looks like a bank deposit, and might actually *be* a bank deposit under the hood, must earn revenue in the same way that bank deposits earn revenue, via net interest margin. It does and in high-interest environments, like the one weâ€™re currently living in (at least i[n the U.S.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=IRSTCI01JPM156N)), this is lucrative. Paypal earned nearly $500 million in interest on customer balances last year, per their [2023 annual report](https://s201.q4cdn.com/231198771/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/PayPal-Holdings-Inc-Combined-2024-Proxy-Statement-and-2023-Annual-Report.pdf). Most of that is very high margin revenue, but it is *not the ballgame*. The real prize is having vastly better economics on the transactions.
