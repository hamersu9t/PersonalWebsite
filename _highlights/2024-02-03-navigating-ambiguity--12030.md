title: Navigating Ambiguity.
---

My biggest advice on solving deeply ambiguous problems is pretty simple: don’t overreact when you get stuck. If you can’t make progress, then escalate. If escalating doesn’t clarify the path forward, then slow down until circumstances evolve. Failing to solve an ambiguous problem is often the only reasonable outcome. The only true failure is if feeling stuck leads you to push so hard that you alienate those working on the problem with you.
