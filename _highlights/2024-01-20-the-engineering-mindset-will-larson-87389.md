No mottos, but I can think of two things I thought about a lot. At Uber is something I talk to people a lot because it was a challenging time for much of it. It was there's no way around, just through. And that was like, "Hey, we're not going to dodge around this. We're going to gut through it and we're going to get to the other side and then we're going to be there." What I think about a lot more now is, will anyone remember what we decided in six months? Because I think people stress out about a lot of decisions, but I increasingly believe most decisions people stress out about just aren't that important.

So I'm like, "Will anyone care in six months what we did here?" And the answer is no. Just do something reasonable and let's move on to the next more important thing.
