Data models are the intersection of the interfaces and state, constraining your stateful system’s capabilities down to what your application considers legal. A good data model is rigid: it only exposes what it genuinely supports and prevents invalid states’ expression. A good data model is tolerant of evolution over time. Effective data models are not even slightly clever.
