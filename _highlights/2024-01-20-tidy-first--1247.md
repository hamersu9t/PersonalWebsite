Here’s something I believe but can’t prove or adequately explain: the more you reduce coupling for one class of changes, the greater the coupling becomes for other classes of changes. The practical implication of this (if it matches your intuition) is that you shouldn’t bother to squeeze out every last bit of coupling. The coupling created in doing so isn’t worth it.
