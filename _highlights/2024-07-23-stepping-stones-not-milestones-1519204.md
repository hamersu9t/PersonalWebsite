title: Stepping Stones Not Milestones
---

â€¢   Stepping stones allow us to learn something! By building a smaller version of the project, we drastically reduce the scope of unknown unknowns. Problems that seemed open-ended and intractable at the start now just seem like obvious next-steps once the solution space has been trimmed down.

Deploying a simpler but less efficient version of a storage system is a **concrete deliverable** that we can start using now. Refactoring an API to decouple clients from a backend and simplify application development **brings real value** and **allows us to learn** what API works for applications. Using an off-the-shelf component instead of something custom is still **directionally consistent** with where we want to go. All these stepping stones take us closer to our end goal and reduce the scope of unknowns along the way.
