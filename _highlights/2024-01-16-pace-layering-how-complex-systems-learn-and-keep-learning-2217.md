title: 'Pace Layering: How Complex Systems Learn and Keep Learning'
---

From the fastest layers to the slowest layers in the system, the relationship can be described as follows:

Fast learns, slow remembers. Fast proposes, slow disposes. Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous. Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and by occasional revolution. Slow and big controls small and fast by constraint and constancy. *Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power.*

All durable dynamic systems have this sort of structure. It is what makes them adaptable and robust.
