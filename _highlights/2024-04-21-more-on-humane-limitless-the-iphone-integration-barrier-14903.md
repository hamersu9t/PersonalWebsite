note: Antitrust case against [[Apple]]. Humane is attempting to exist outside the
  Apple ecosystem but that’s its greatest flaw. It does demonstrate hubris from the
  company, they didn’t learn the right lessons from the iPhone launch (namely that
  it started by offloading functionality to desktops and after years of goodwill built
  with devs), but also does show how impossible it is to exist outside of the smartphone
  currently. Generally, antitrust cases against Apple are difficult as most of the
  company's decisions benefit the consumer. Taking the competition-stifling perspective
  perhaps allows a longer term harmful view of the consumer

title: More on Humane, Limitless, the iPhone Integration Barrier
---

The broader question of private APIs for external hardware, though, is a very big deal for tech innovation going forward. I quoted that blog post from Sandofsky extensively at the beginning because of his systematic takedown of Humane’s insistence on being independent of the iPhone, but the other question to raise is if Humane could have even functioned as an iPhone accessory? I don’t think so, and that strikes me as a big problem for innovation going forward.
