title: Tech for Trump, Breaking the Deal, From Inertness to Interest
---

Kelsey Piper of Vox picked up on this segment as well; from X:

I think “there was a deal and it has broken down” is an incredibly powerful and pervasive sentiment in tech, not just among Trump supporters but among committed and sincere liberals too. [*link*](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1813315919697027559)

What was the deal? Hard to pin down exactly but something like – we will build ambitious things and pay high taxes and donate lots of money and mostly not play politics and you will treat us as valued pillars of our community, make our cities livable, stay mostly out of the way.

The abrupt tilt towards intensely negative coverage of tech felt like a breakdown of the deal. The attacks on tech shuttle buses? Breakdown of the deal. The state of San Francisco? Breakdown of the deal. [*link*](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1813315922813403161)

Like all narratives this one captures some things and misses others. And I don’t think that putting corrupt right wing nativists in power solves the justified anger here. But there is justified anger here. California politicians have egregiously failed their constituents. [*link*](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1813316657525543029)
