title: The West’s Anti-Colonial Struggle Is Real
---

The Ottoman Empire’s “Millet System,” for example, was a system of “multi-cultural” imperial administration, in which religious and ethnic minority groups across the empire were granted autonomy and even special privileges – to such a degree that official recognition as a minority group became something of a prized status for which various groups would actively lobby the Sultan.[1](https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/the-wests-anti-colonial-struggle?publication_id=330796&r=1xrbhi&utm_campaign=email-post-title#_ftn1) The Ottoman elite would then tap these loyal minorities for administrative and military talent. This helped keep their expansive empire relatively stable for centuries.
