You always need to invest in design and planning ahead of time, but you need to accept that the solution to your end goal is much hazier than a single point and that the path to get there isnâ€™t a straight line. Your project strategy defines an approximate solution space. Your job is to make your way towards an acceptable solution while not deviating from that strategy.
