title: Stepping Stones Not Milestones
---

Instead of splitting a project up into arbitrary milestones, consider delivering incremental value by shipping concrete stepping stones. Stepping stones can serve to de-risk a project by minimizing dependencies and providing standalone checkpoints. Most importantly however they help to simplify a complex project by providing a means to structure deliverables around eliminating unknown unknowns. Formulating useful stepping stones is an art and often requires an intense focus on simplicity to avoid deviating out of the cone of strategy along the way to an end goal.
