I worry that overproductivity is an unfortunate artifact of [“Frictionless Reproducibility.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00865) Artificial intelligence advances by inventing games and gloating to goad others to play. [I’ve talked about how benchmark competitions are the prime mover of AI progress.](https://www.argmin.net/p/the-department-of-frictionless-reproducibilty) But what if AI people have decided (perhaps subconsciously) that publishing itself is a game? Well, then you can just run reinforcement learning on your research career.
