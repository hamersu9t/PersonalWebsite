title: 'Digg''s v4 launch: an optimism born of necessity.'
---

we’d have preferred to launch something great, but instead we had the choice of taking one last swing or turning in our bat quietly.

I’m glad we took the last swing; proud we survived the rough launch.

On the other hand, I’m still shocked that we were so reckless in the launch itself. I remember the meeting where we decided to go ahead with the launch, with Mike vigorously protesting. To the best of my recollection, I remained silent. I hope that I grew from the experience, because even now I’m uncertain how such a talented group put on that display of fuckery.
