title: Will A.I. Break the Internet? Or Save It?
---

Thereâ€™s no achievement for it to like me. The fact that there is a human on the other side of most text messages I send matters, I care about it because it is another mind. The kindroid might be better in a formulaic way. The kindroid might be better in terms of like the actual text. I can sort of tune it more to my kind of theoretical liking. But the friction of another person is meaningful to me. Like I care that my best friend likes me and could choose not to. Is there an aura problem here?
