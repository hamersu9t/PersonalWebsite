title: Constraints on Giving Feedback. @ Irrational Exuberance
---

Feedback is conveying information to someone about how they are impacting something. For example, “Hey Will, it felt like you focused on convincing the CFO about the cost impact of your hiring plan, but didn’t spend time convincing anyone else that the plan was worthwhile, even if the cost was low. It would have worked better if you’d started on why it’s useful before getting caught up on how to minimize the expense.” People also talk *a lot* about their views on the behavior of a third party. Going back to my last example, if the head of product complained to the CFO that Will (the head of engineering) didn’t even explain their proposal, that’s not feedback (it’s being delivered to an uninvolved party), that’s just commentary about the head of engineering’s behavior.
